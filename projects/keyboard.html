                    <h1>Keyboard Build</h1>
                    <p>The main goal of this project was to learn schematic capture and PCB layout. Before starting the project, I set a list of criteria for the final product:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The keyboard must use a compact layout, similar to that of a laptop keyboard</li>
                        <li>The casing must be as low profile as possible</li>
                        <li>The keyboard must have bluetooth and USB functionality</li>
                    </ul> 
                    <p>I created my desired layout using <a href="http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/" target="_blank">keyboard layout editor</a>. The outer casing was purchased since manufacturing was not possible within the project timeframe. Other parts were selected mainly based on their thickness due to space constraints.
                    <p>The PCB schematic and layout were designed in KiCad. The battery charging circuitry, bluetooth, and usb are handled by an <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather/overview" target="_blank">Adafruit Feather</a>.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>The PCB was made single layer to be easily manufactured using DIY methods.</p>
                    <div class="img-holder">
                        <img src="../images/projects/keyboard/pcb.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <p>The PCB was CNC machined on a copper clad FR4 board.</p>
                    <div class="img-holder">
                        <img src="../images/projects/keyboard/cnc.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <p>All the parts before and after assembly:</p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="img-holder">

                    </div>
                    <p>I used the <a href="https://qmk.fm/">QMK project</a> to quickly build the firmware. Unfortunately, due to the hardware design of the Adafruit Feather and poor wireless support of QMK, the battery life is very short.
                    I was also too optimistic with the RF performance despite using an all metal enclosure. The range and latenency ended up being very poor and I only use the keyboard wired :(</p>
                    <p>I'm planning to do a new version using the newer <a href="https://zmk.dev/">ZMK project</a> and build my pcb with fully integrated circuits intead of a premade board like the Feather.</p>
